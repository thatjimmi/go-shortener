This service was designed to provide quick and easy conversion of long URLs into shorter, more manageable links that are perfect for sharing. To enhance user convenience, I simultaneously developed a Chrome extension. This extension simplified the process of using shortened URLs, allowing users to effortlessly be redirected by typing `to/link` in their browser.
